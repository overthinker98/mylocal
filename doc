Cgroups- Cgroups or control groups are used to limit the resources used bt a process in a container. As there are limited resources alloted for a process, in a cluster which runs multiple containers, metering of resources is needed. There are two types of Cgroup limits 
1) soft limit
2) hard limit

1) Hard limit: Hard limit is a type of limit where if a process reaches its max quota of limit it tends to exit/stop the process.
2) Soft limit: Soft limits are a type a limit where if the lift is hit it doesn't stop the process but it checks for the available resources from other                resources and gets the available. (check??)
